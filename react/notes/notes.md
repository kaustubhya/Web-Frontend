Whenever a site is loaded, the first file that is run is "index.html".

In src folder, index.js is run first.

render means display or show data.

Working flow:

- Initially, we declare an empty div with id root in index.html

- Then in index.js, we decalre a const variable and it creates a root element in react DOM (it took the div with id root in index.html)

- Finally we call the app component in app.js (we call it using the variable name declared in const).

setupTests.js - This file is used for testing our React code.
