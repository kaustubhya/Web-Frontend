Import a Google Font
In addition to specifying common fonts that are found on most operating systems, we can also specify non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website. There are many sources for web fonts on the Internet. For this example we will focus on the Google Fonts library.

Google Fonts is a free library of web fonts that you can use in your CSS by referencing the font's URL.

So, let's go ahead and import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is blocked in your country, you will need to skip this challenge).

To import a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge, we'll import the Lobster font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor (before the opening style element):

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
Now you can use the Lobster font in your CSS by using Lobster as the FAMILY_NAME as in the following example:

font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;
The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available. This is covered in the next challenge.

Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font, but not to use the Lobster font.

Import the Lobster font to your web page. Then, use an element selector to set Lobster as the font-family for your h2 element.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster"
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
/>

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family: "Lobster";
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"
    ><img
      src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
      alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."
  /></a>

  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>catnip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>flea treatment</li>
      <li>thunder</li>
      <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked /> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" /> Outdoor</label><br />
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked /> Loving</label>

    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" /> Energetic</label><br />
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>
```

Specify How Fonts Should Degrade
There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif.

When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but degrade to the sans-serif font when Helvetica isn't available, you will specify it as follows:

p {
font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes because they are CSS keywords.

To begin, apply the monospace font to the h2 element, so that it now has two fonts - Lobster and monospace.

In the last challenge, you imported the Lobster font using the link tag. Now comment out that import of the Lobster font (using the HTML comments you learned before) from Google Fonts so that it isn't available anymore. Notice how your h2 element degrades to the monospace font.

Note: If you have the Lobster font installed on your computer, you won't see the degradation because your browser is able to find the font.

Add Borders Around Your Elements

CSS borders have properties like style, color and width.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:

<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>

Create a class called thick-green-border. This class should add a 10px, solid, green border around an HTML element. Apply the class to your cat photo.

Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:

<img class="class1 class2">

---

Set the id of an Element
In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.

There are several benefits to using id attributes: You can use an id to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.

id attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same id attribute.

Here's an example of how you give your h2 element the id of cat-photo-app:

<h2 id="cat-photo-app">
Give your form element the id cat-photo-form.

---

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.

Try to set the margin to a negative value like the one for the red box.

Change the margin of the blue box to -15px, so it fills the entire horizontal width of the yellow box around it

---

`em` is font size of an element relative to its parent font size.

---

Yay! We just proved that inline styles will override all the CSS declarations in your style element.

But wait. There's one last way to override CSS. This is the most powerful method of all. But before we do it, let's talk about why you would ever want to override CSS.

In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important.

Let's go all the way back to our pink-text class declaration. Remember that our pink-text class was overridden by subsequent class declarations, id declarations, and inline styles.

Let's add the keyword !important to your pink-text element's color declaration to make 100% sure that your h1 element will be pink.

---

Use Hex Code to Mix Colors
To review, hex codes use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.

From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue), we can vary the amounts of each to create over 16 million other colors!

For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to being #FFA500.

The digit 0 is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.

The digit F is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness.

Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it.

For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00. This shortened form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, and one digit for blue.

This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.

---

Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using RGB values.

The RGB value for black looks like this:

rgb(0, 0, 0)
The RGB value for white looks like this:

rgb(255, 255, 255)
Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.

If you do the math, the two digits for one color equal 16 times 16, which gives us 256 total values. So RGB, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex code.

Here's an example of how you'd change the body background to orange using its RGB code.

1 digit (16 combinations)

2 digits (16 \* 16 = 256 combinations) (0 to 255)

---

Create a custom CSS Variable
To create a CSS variable, you just need to give it a name with two hyphens in front of it and assign it a value like this:

--penguin-skin: gray;
This will create a variable named --penguin-skin and assign it the value of gray. Now you can use that variable elsewhere in your CSS to change the value of other properties to gray.

In the penguin class, create a variable name --penguin-skin and give it a value of gray.

```html
<style>
  .penguin {
    /* Only change code below this line */

    /* Only change code above this line */
    position: relative;
    margin: auto;
    display: block;
    margin-top: 5%;
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    --penguin-skin: gray;
  }

  .penguin-top {
    top: 10%;
    left: 25%;
    background: black;
    width: 50%;
    height: 45%;
    border-radius: 70% 70% 60% 60%;
  }

  .penguin-bottom {
    top: 40%;
    left: 23.5%;
    background: black;
    width: 53%;
    height: 45%;
    border-radius: 70% 70% 100% 100%;
  }

  .right-hand {
    top: 0%;
    left: -5%;
    background: black;
    width: 30%;
    height: 60%;
    border-radius: 30% 30% 120% 30%;
    transform: rotate(45deg);
    z-index: -1;
  }

  .left-hand {

    left: 75%;
    background: black;
    width: 30%;
    height: 60%;
    border-radius: 30% 30% 30% 120%;
    transform: rotate(-45deg);
    z-index: -1;
  }

  .right-cheek {
    top: 15%;
    left: 35%;
    background: white;
    width: 60%;
    height: 70%;
    border-radius: 70% 70% 60% 60%;
  }

  .left-cheek {
    top: 15%;
    left: 5%;
    background: white;
    width: 60%;
    height: 70%;
    border-radius: 70% 70% 60% 60%;
  }

  .belly {
    top: 60%;
    left: 2.5%;
    background: white;
    width: 95%;
    height: 100%;
    border-radius: 120% 120% 100% 100%;
  }

  .right-feet {
    top: 85%;
    left: 60%;
    background: orange;
    width: 15%;
    height: 30%;
    border-radius: 50% 50% 50% 50%;
    transform: rotate(-80deg);
    z-index: -2222;
  }

  .left-feet {
    top: 85%;
    left: 25%;
    background: orange;
    width: 15%;
    height: 30%;
    border-radius: 50% 50% 50% 50%;
    transform: rotate(80deg);
    z-index: -2222;
  }

  .right-eye {
    top: 45%;
    left: 60%;
    background: black;
    width: 15%;
    height: 17%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .left-eye {
    top: 45%;
    left: 25%;
    background: black;
    width: 15%;
    height: 17%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .sparkle {
    top: 25%;
    left: 15%;
    background: white;
    width: 35%;
    height: 35%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .blush-right {
    top: 65%;
    left: 15%;
    background: pink;
    width: 15%;
    height: 10%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .blush-left {
    top: 65%;
    left: 70%;
    background: pink;
    width: 15%;
    height: 10%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .beak-top {
    top: 60%;
    left: 40%;
    background: orange;
    width: 20%;
    height: 10%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .beak-bottom {
    top: 65%;
    left: 42%;
    background: orange;
    width: 16%;
    height: 10%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  body {
    background: #c6faf1;
  }

  .penguin * {
    position: absolute;
  }
</style>
<div class="penguin">
  <div class="penguin-bottom">
    <div class="right-hand"></div>
    <div class="left-hand"></div>
    <div class="right-feet"></div>
    <div class="left-feet"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="penguin-top">
    <div class="right-cheek"></div>
    <div class="left-cheek"></div>
    <div class="belly"></div>
    <div class="right-eye">
      <div class="sparkle"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="left-eye">
      <div class="sparkle"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="blush-right"></div>
    <div class="blush-left"></div>
    <div class="beak-top"></div>
    <div class="beak-bottom"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

After you create your variable, you can assign its value to other CSS properties by referencing the name you gave it.

background: var(--penguin-skin);
This will change the background of whatever element you are targeting to gray because that is the value of the --penguin-skin variable. Note that styles will not be applied unless the variable names are an exact match.

Apply the --penguin-skin variable to the background property of the penguin-top, penguin-bottom, right-hand and left-hand classes.

When using your variable as a CSS property value, you can attach a fallback value that your browser will revert to if the given variable is invalid.

Note: This fallback is not used to increase browser compatibility, and it will not work on IE browsers. Rather, it is used so that the browser has a color to display if it cannot find your variable.

Here's how you do it:

background: var(--penguin-skin, black);
This will set background to black if your variable wasn't set. Note that this can be useful for debugging.

It looks like there is a problem with the variables supplied to the .penguin-top and .penguin-bottom classes. Rather than fix the typo, add a fallback value of black to the background property of the .penguin-top and .penguin-bottom classes.

Improve Compatibility with Browser Fallbacks
When working with CSS you will likely run into browser compatibility issues at some point. This is why it's important to provide browser fallbacks to avoid potential problems.

When your browser parses the CSS of a webpage, it ignores any properties that it doesn't recognize or support. For example, if you use a CSS variable to assign a background color on a site, Internet Explorer will ignore the background color because it does not support CSS variables. In that case, the browser will use whatever value it has for that property. If it can't find any other value set for that property, it will revert to the default value, which is typically not ideal.

This means that if you do want to provide a browser fallback, it's as easy as providing another more widely supported value immediately before your declaration. That way an older browser will have something to fall back on, while a newer browser will just interpret whatever declaration comes later in the cascade.

It looks like a variable is being used to set the background color of the .red-box class. Let's improve our browser compatibility by adding another background declaration right before the existing declaration and set its value to red.

```cpp
<style>
  :root {
    --red-color: red;
  }
  .red-box {
    background: red;
    background: var(--red-color);
    height: 200px;
    width:200px;
  }
</style>
<div class="red-box"></div>
```

Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property
This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; spaces the text so that each line has equal width.

text-align: center; centers the text

text-align: right; right-aligns the text

And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.

The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear

The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes the following values, in order:

offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element)
offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element)
blur-radius
spread-radius
color
The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.

Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:

box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px

The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.

A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
A value of 0 is completely transparent.
The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.

Set the opacity of the anchor tags to 0.7 using links class to select them.

The text-transform property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.

The following table shows how the different text-transformvalues change the example text "Transform me".

Value Result
lowercase "transform me"
uppercase "TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize "Transform Me"
initial Use the default value
inherit Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none Default: Use the original text

When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:

Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position.

Note: Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.

eg

```css
p {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 10px;
}

/* move 10px away from bottom */
```

---

The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.

The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.

One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.

The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.

When elements are positioned to overlap (i.e. using position: absolute | relative | fixed | sticky), the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the z-index property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.

Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. One way to do this is to set its margin to a value of auto.

This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when you set the display property to block.

Color theory and its impact on design is a deep topic and only the basics are covered in the following challenges. On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with your content.

The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they "cancel" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.

Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:

red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)
This is different than the outdated RYB color model that many of us were taught in school, which has different primary and complementary colors. Modern color theory uses the additive RGB model (like on a computer screen) and the subtractive CMY(K) model (like in printing).

There are many color picking tools available online that have an option to find the complement of a color.

Note: Using color can be a powerful way to add visual interest to a page. However, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because users with visual impairments may not understand that content. This issue will be covered in more detail in the Applied Accessibility challenges.

Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G). You saw these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.

Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:

Color Hex Code
orange #FF7F00
cyan #00FFFF
raspberry #FF007F

With the increase of internet connected devices, their sizes and specifications vary, and the displays they use could be different externally and internally. Pixel density is an aspect that could be different on one device from others and this density is known as Pixel Per Inch(PPI) or Dots Per Inch(DPI). The most famous such display is the one known as a "Retina Display" on the latest Apple MacBook Pro notebooks, and recently iMac computers. Due to the difference in pixel density between a "Retina" and "Non-Retina" displays, some images that have not been made with a High-Resolution Display in mind could look "pixelated" when rendered on a High-Resolution display.

The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is. Here is an example of an image that is only using half of the original height and width:

<style>
  img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
</style>
<img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">
Set the width and height of the img tag to half of their original values. In this case, both the original height and the original width are 200px.

Instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for responsive typography. Viewport units, like percentages, are relative units, but they are based off different items. Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.

The four different viewport units are:

vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
Here is an example that sets a body tag to 30% of the viewport's width.

body { width: 30vw; }
Set the width of the h2 tag to 80% of the viewport's width and the width of the paragraph as 75% of the viewport's smaller dimension.

Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the hsl() function as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.

Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360.

Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.

Here are a few examples of using hsl() with fully-saturated, normal lightness colors:

Color HSL
red hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
yellow hsl(60, 100%, 50%)
green hsl(120, 100%, 50%)
cyan hsl(180, 100%, 50%)
blue hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
magenta hsl(300, 100%, 50%)

eg.
background-color: hsl(180, 80%, 25%);

180 -> hue code
80% -> 80 % pure hue, 20% grey added
25% -> 25% white 75% black

Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function. Here is the general syntax:

background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);
The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a horizontal gradient (from left to right) and 45deg makes a diagonal gradient (from bottom left to top right). The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.

Example:

background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));

The repeating-linear-gradient() function is very similar to linear-gradient() with the major difference that it repeats the specified gradient pattern. repeating-linear-gradient() accepts a variety of values, but for simplicity, you'll work with an angle value and color stop values in this challenge.

The angle value is the direction of the gradient. Color stops are like width values that mark where a transition takes place, and are given with a percentage or a number of pixels.

In the example demonstrated in the code editor, the gradient starts with the color yellow at 0 pixels which blends into the second color blue at 40 pixels away from the start. Since the next color stop is also at 40 pixels, the gradient immediately changes to the third color green, which itself blends into the fourth color value red as that is 80 pixels away from the beginning of the gradient.

For this example, it helps to think about the color stops as pairs where every two colors blend together.

0px [yellow -- blend -- blue] 40px [green -- blend -- red] 80px
If every two color stop values are the same color, the blending isn't noticeable because it's between the same color, followed by a hard transition to the next color, so you end up with stripes.

To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function. The following code example doubles the size of all the paragraph elements on the page:

p {
transform: scale(2);
}

The transform property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.

Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:

p:hover {
transform: scale(2.1);
}
Note: Applying a transform to a div element will also affect any child elements contained in the div.

The next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.

The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.

p {
transform: skewX(-32deg);
}

Given that the skewX() function skews the selected element along the X-axis by a given degree, it is no surprise that the skewY() property skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.

By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

You will create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly offset to the side - the shadow is actually going to be the moon shape you see.

In order to create a round object, the border-radius property should be set to a value of 50%.

You may recall from an earlier challenge that the box-shadow property takes values for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

Manipulate the square element in the editor to create the moon shape. First, change the background-color to transparent, then set the border-radius property to 50% to make the circular shape. Finally, change the box-shadow property to set the offset-x to 25px, the offset-y to 10px, blur-radius to 0, spread-radius to 0, and color to blue.

Cresent moon

```css
<style>
  .center {
    position: absolute;
    margin: auto;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: transparent;
    border-radius: 50%;
    box-shadow: 25px 10px 0 0 blue;
  }

</style>
<div class="center"></div>
```

One of the most popular shapes in the world is the heart shape, and in this challenge you'll create one using pure CSS. But first, you need to understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element; ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element. In the following example, a ::before pseudo-element is used to add a rectangle to an element with the class heart:

.heart::before {
content: "";
background-color: yellow;
border-radius: 25%;
position: absolute;
height: 50px;
width: 70px;
top: -50px;
left: 5px;
}
For the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to function properly, they must have a defined content property. This property is usually used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. When the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to make shapes, the content property is still required, but it's set to an empty string. In the above example, the element with the class of heart has a ::before pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively. This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% border-radius and is positioned absolutely at 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.

Transform the element on the screen to a heart. In the .heart::after selector, change the background-color to pink and the border-radius to 50%.

Next, target the element with the class heart (just heart) and fill in the transform property. Use the rotate() function with -45 degrees.

Finally, in the .heart::before selector, set its content property to an empty string.

To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.

animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.

@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of @keyframes and the animation properties:

#anim {
animation-name: colorful;
animation-duration: 3s;
}

@keyframes colorful {
0% {
background-color: blue;
}
100% {
background-color: yellow;
}
}
For the element with the anim id, the code snippet above sets the animation-name to colorful and sets the animation-duration to 3 seconds. Then the @keyframes rule links to the animation properties with the name colorful. It sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to yellow by the end of the animation (100%). You aren't limited to only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the element for any percentage between 0% and 100%.

Create an animation for the element with the id rect, by setting the animation-name to rainbow and the animation-duration to 4 seconds. Next, declare a @keyframes rule, and set the background-color at the beginning of the animation (0%) to blue, the middle of the animation (50%) to green, and the end of the animation (100%) to yellow.

You can use CSS @keyframes to change the color of a button in its hover state.

Here's an example of changing the width of an image on hover:

<style>
  img {
    width: 30px;
  }
  img:hover {
    animation-name: width;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
  }

  @keyframes width {
    100% {
      width: 40px;
    }
  }
</style>

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/applied-visual-design/google-logo.png" alt="Google's Logo" />

1ms = 1 millisecond

That's great, but it doesn't work right yet. Notice how the animation resets after 500ms has passed, causing the button to revert back to the original color. You want the button to stay highlighted.

This can be done by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards. The animation-fill-mode specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished. You can set it like so:

animation-fill-mode: forwards;

The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:

animation-iteration-count: 3;
In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to infinite.

For this challenge, you'll change the opacity of an animated element so it gradually fades as it reaches the right side of the screen.

In the displayed animation, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right by the 50% mark of the animation per the @keyframes rule.

Target the element with the id of ball and add the opacity property set to 0.1 at 50%, so the element fades as it moves to the right.

In the previous challenge, you changed the animation rates for two similarly animated elements by altering their @keyframes rules. You can achieve the same goal by manipulating the animation-duration of multiple elements.

In the animation running in the code editor, there are three stars in the sky that twinkle at the same rate on a continuous loop. To make them twinkle at different rates, you can set the animation-duration property to different values for each element.

In CSS animations, the animation-timing-function property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time (your animation-duration), the animation-timing-function says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of the drive.

There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is ease, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again in the end. Other options include ease-out, which is quick in the beginning then slows down, ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end, or linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.

---

The last challenge introduced the animation-timing-function property and a few keywords that change the speed of an animation over its duration. CSS offers an option other than keywords that provides even finer control over how the animation plays out, through the use of Bezier curves.

In CSS animations, Bezier curves are used with the cubic-bezier function. The shape of the curve represents how the animation plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the duration of the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation.

The cubic-bezier function consists of four main points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid: p0, p1, p2, and p3. p0 and p3 are set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively at the origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you place them in the grid dictates the shape of the curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS by declaring the x and y values of the p1 and p2 "anchor" points in the form: (x1, y1, x2, y2). Pulling it all together, here's an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:

animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);

In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2), which if you remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1). This animation is a linear change of an element during the length of an animation, and is the same as using the linear keyword. In other words, it changes at a constant speed.

For the element with the id of ball1, change the value of the animation-timing-function property from linear to its equivalent cubic-bezier function value. Use the point values given in the example above.

A previous challenge discussed the ease-out keyword that describes an animation change that speeds up first and then slows down at the end of the animation. On the right, the difference between the ease-out keyword (for the blue element) and linear keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. Similar animation progressions to the ease-out keyword can be achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier curve function.

In general, changing the p1 and p2 anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, which controls how the animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to mimic the ease-out style:

animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);
Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, then goes to p2 y value of 1) than it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.

This challenge animates an element to replicate the movement of a ball being juggled. Prior challenges covered the linear and ease-out cubic Bezier curves, however neither depicts the juggling movement accurately. You need to customize a Bezier curve for this.

The animation-timing-function automatically loops at every keyframe when the animation-iteration-count is set to infinite. Since there is a keyframe rule set in the middle of the animation duration (at 50%), it results in two identical animation progressions at the upward and downward movement of the ball.

The following cubic Bezier curve simulates a juggling movement:

cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.6);
Notice that the value of y2 is larger than 1. Although the cubic Bezier curve is mapped on a 1 by 1 coordinate system, and it can only accept x values from 0 to 1, the y value can be set to numbers larger than one. This results in a bouncing movement that is ideal for simulating the juggling ball.

The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to surround the information related to your page's central topic. It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.

The main tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to navigate to the main content quickly. If you've ever seen a "Jump to Main Content" link at the top of a page, using the main tag automatically gives assistive devices that functionality.

article is another one of the new HTML5 elements that add semantic meaning to your markup. article is a sectioning element and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.

Note: The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.

<div> - groups content <section> - groups related content <article> - groups independent, self-contained content

The flex-basis property specifies the initial size of the item before CSS makes adjustments with flex-shrink or flex-grow.

The units used by the flex-basis property are the same as other size properties (px, em, %, etc.). The value auto sizes items based on the content.

Set the initial size of the boxes using flex-basis. Add the CSS property flex-basis to both #box-1 and #box-2. Give #box-1 a value of 10em and #box-2 a value of 20em.

For example, flex: 1 0 10px; will set the item to flex-grow: 1;, flex-shrink: 0;, and flex-basis: 10px;.
