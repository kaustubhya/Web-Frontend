Import a Google Font
In addition to specifying common fonts that are found on most operating systems, we can also specify non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website. There are many sources for web fonts on the Internet. For this example we will focus on the Google Fonts library.

Google Fonts is a free library of web fonts that you can use in your CSS by referencing the font's URL.

So, let's go ahead and import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is blocked in your country, you will need to skip this challenge).

To import a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge, we'll import the Lobster font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor (before the opening style element):

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
Now you can use the Lobster font in your CSS by using Lobster as the FAMILY_NAME as in the following example:

font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;
The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available. This is covered in the next challenge.

Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font, but not to use the Lobster font.

Import the Lobster font to your web page. Then, use an element selector to set Lobster as the font-family for your h2 element.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster"
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
/>

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family: "Lobster";
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"
    ><img
      src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
      alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."
  /></a>

  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>catnip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>flea treatment</li>
      <li>thunder</li>
      <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked /> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" /> Outdoor</label><br />
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked /> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" /> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" /> Energetic</label><br />
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>
```

Specify How Fonts Should Degrade
There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif.

When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but degrade to the sans-serif font when Helvetica isn't available, you will specify it as follows:

p {
font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes because they are CSS keywords.

To begin, apply the monospace font to the h2 element, so that it now has two fonts - Lobster and monospace.

In the last challenge, you imported the Lobster font using the link tag. Now comment out that import of the Lobster font (using the HTML comments you learned before) from Google Fonts so that it isn't available anymore. Notice how your h2 element degrades to the monospace font.

Note: If you have the Lobster font installed on your computer, you won't see the degradation because your browser is able to find the font.

Add Borders Around Your Elements

CSS borders have properties like style, color and width.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:

<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>

Create a class called thick-green-border. This class should add a 10px, solid, green border around an HTML element. Apply the class to your cat photo.

Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:

<img class="class1 class2">

---

Set the id of an Element
In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.

There are several benefits to using id attributes: You can use an id to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.

id attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same id attribute.

Here's an example of how you give your h2 element the id of cat-photo-app:

<h2 id="cat-photo-app">
Give your form element the id cat-photo-form.

---

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.

Try to set the margin to a negative value like the one for the red box.

Change the margin of the blue box to -15px, so it fills the entire horizontal width of the yellow box around it

---

`em` is font size of an element relative to its parent font size.

---

Yay! We just proved that inline styles will override all the CSS declarations in your style element.

But wait. There's one last way to override CSS. This is the most powerful method of all. But before we do it, let's talk about why you would ever want to override CSS.

In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important.

Let's go all the way back to our pink-text class declaration. Remember that our pink-text class was overridden by subsequent class declarations, id declarations, and inline styles.

Let's add the keyword !important to your pink-text element's color declaration to make 100% sure that your h1 element will be pink.

Use Hex Code to Mix Colors
To review, hex codes use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.

From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue), we can vary the amounts of each to create over 16 million other colors!

For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to being #FFA500.

The digit 0 is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.

The digit F is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness.

Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it.

For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00. This shortened form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, and one digit for blue.

This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.

---

Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using RGB values.

The RGB value for black looks like this:

rgb(0, 0, 0)
The RGB value for white looks like this:

rgb(255, 255, 255)
Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.

If you do the math, the two digits for one color equal 16 times 16, which gives us 256 total values. So RGB, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex code.

Here's an example of how you'd change the body background to orange using its RGB code.

1 digit (16 combinations)

2 digits (16 \* 16 = 256 combinations) (0 to 255)

Create a custom CSS Variable
To create a CSS variable, you just need to give it a name with two hyphens in front of it and assign it a value like this:

--penguin-skin: gray;
This will create a variable named --penguin-skin and assign it the value of gray. Now you can use that variable elsewhere in your CSS to change the value of other properties to gray.

In the penguin class, create a variable name --penguin-skin and give it a value of gray.

```html
<style>
  .penguin {
    /* Only change code below this line */

    /* Only change code above this line */
    position: relative;
    margin: auto;
    display: block;
    margin-top: 5%;
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    --penguin-skin: gray;
  }

  .penguin-top {
    top: 10%;
    left: 25%;
    background: black;
    width: 50%;
    height: 45%;
    border-radius: 70% 70% 60% 60%;
  }

  .penguin-bottom {
    top: 40%;
    left: 23.5%;
    background: black;
    width: 53%;
    height: 45%;
    border-radius: 70% 70% 100% 100%;
  }

  .right-hand {
    top: 0%;
    left: -5%;
    background: black;
    width: 30%;
    height: 60%;
    border-radius: 30% 30% 120% 30%;
    transform: rotate(45deg);
    z-index: -1;

    background: black;
    width: 30%;
    height: 60%;

    transform: rotate(-45deg);
    z-index: -1;
  }

  .right-cheek {
    top: 15%;
    left: 35%;
    background: white;
    width: 60%;
    height: 70%;
    border-radius: 70% 70% 60% 60%;
  }

  .left-cheek {
    top: 15%;
    left: 5%;
    background: white;
    width: 60%;
    height: 70%;
    border-radius: 70% 70% 60% 60%;
  }

  .belly {
    top: 60%;
    left: 2.5%;
    background: white;
    width: 95%;
    height: 100%;
    border-radius: 120% 120% 100% 100%;
  }

  .right-feet {
    top: 85%;
    left: 60%;
    background: orange;
    width: 15%;
    height: 30%;
    border-radius: 50% 50% 50% 50%;
    transform: rotate(-80deg);
    z-index: -2222;
  }

  .left-feet {
    top: 85%;
    left: 25%;
    background: orange;
    width: 15%;
    height: 30%;
    border-radius: 50% 50% 50% 50%;
    transform: rotate(80deg);
    z-index: -2222;
  }

  .right-eye {
    top: 45%;
    left: 60%;
    background: black;
    width: 15%;
    height: 17%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .left-eye {
    top: 45%;
    left: 25%;
    background: black;
    width: 15%;
    height: 17%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .sparkle {
    top: 25%;
    left: 15%;
    background: white;
    width: 35%;
    height: 35%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .blush-right {
    top: 65%;
    left: 15%;
    background: pink;
    width: 15%;
    height: 10%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .blush-left {
    top: 65%;
    left: 70%;
    background: pink;
    width: 15%;
    height: 10%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .beak-top {
    top: 60%;
    left: 40%;
    background: orange;
    width: 20%;
    height: 10%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .beak-bottom {
    top: 65%;
    left: 42%;
    background: orange;
    width: 16%;
    height: 10%;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  body {
    background: #c6faf1;
  }

  .penguin * {
    position: absolute;
  }
</style>
<div class="penguin">
  <div class="penguin-bottom">
    <div class="right-hand"></div>
    <div class="left-hand"></div>
    <div class="right-feet"></div>
    <div class="left-feet"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="penguin-top">
    <div class="right-cheek"></div>
    <div class="left-cheek"></div>
    <div class="belly"></div>
    <div class="right-eye">
      <div class="sparkle"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="left-eye">
      <div class="sparkle"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="blush-right"></div>
    <div class="blush-left"></div>
    <div class="beak-top"></div>
    <div class="beak-bottom"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

After you create your variable, you can assign its value to other CSS properties by referencing the name you gave it.

background: var(--penguin-skin);
This will change the background of whatever element you are targeting to gray because that is the value of the --penguin-skin variable. Note that styles will not be applied unless the variable names are an exact match.

Apply the --penguin-skin variable to the background property of the penguin-top, penguin-bottom, right-hand and left-hand classes.

When using your variable as a CSS property value, you can attach a fallback value that your browser will revert to if the given variable is invalid.

Note: This fallback is not used to increase browser compatibility, and it will not work on IE browsers. Rather, it is used so that the browser has a color to display if it cannot find your variable.

Here's how you do it:

background: var(--penguin-skin, black);
This will set background to black if your variable wasn't set. Note that this can be useful for debugging.

It looks like there is a problem with the variables supplied to the .penguin-top and .penguin-bottom classes. Rather than fix the typo, add a fallback value of black to the background property of the .penguin-top and .penguin-bottom classes.

Improve Compatibility with Browser Fallbacks
When working with CSS you will likely run into browser compatibility issues at some point. This is why it's important to provide browser fallbacks to avoid potential problems.

When your browser parses the CSS of a webpage, it ignores any properties that it doesn't recognize or support. For example, if you use a CSS variable to assign a background color on a site, Internet Explorer will ignore the background color because it does not support CSS variables. In that case, the browser will use whatever value it has for that property. If it can't find any other value set for that property, it will revert to the default value, which is typically not ideal.

This means that if you do want to provide a browser fallback, it's as easy as providing another more widely supported value immediately before your declaration. That way an older browser will have something to fall back on, while a newer browser will just interpret whatever declaration comes later in the cascade.

It looks like a variable is being used to set the background color of the .red-box class. Let's improve our browser compatibility by adding another background declaration right before the existing declaration and set its value to red.

```cpp
<style>
  :root {
    --red-color: red;
  }
  .red-box {
    background: red;
    background: var(--red-color);
    height: 200px;
    width:200px;
  }
</style>
<div class="red-box"></div>
```
