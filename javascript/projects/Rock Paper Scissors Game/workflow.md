Focusing on JS part

- Select all 3 buttons(rock, paper and scissors) using .querySelector
- Add event listener in all of them
- in function, first use console.log to check if event listener is working or not
- then we will add animation class in html to start animation when button is clicked. We will do it via JS i.e. adding classes of animation inside user and computer hands. The hands move infinitely now
- To make the hands stop moving after 2sec we will use setTimeout inside which we will remove the animation class from user and computer hand
- Next we set inner text of user hand
- And we set inner text of computer hand using a random function() which chooses from an array of options
- Next we work on resetting the hands after each draw
- Finally we work on the result logic where we display result text and update scores
